      <p>
        I love helping others and solving problems. That was also one of the
        reasons for me to be a financial advisor, assisting others to resolve
        their financial issues. Starting a career in software engineering would
        be more satisfying for me, knowing that the product I create would help
        a much larger group of people, making their lives better, and of course,
        solving problems at a much larger scale. I also enjoy the satisfaction
        of creating things which is part of a software engineerâ€™s daily life.

        I love coding. Coding is like creating something new and helpful. My
        undergraduate and graduate study is about chemical and environmental
        engineering. I am also a CFP and EA. Transition to coding is awesome!
