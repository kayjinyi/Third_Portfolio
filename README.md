## Descripttion

Being a web developer means being part of a community. Creating a portfolio using React skills is cool.

When employers looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, They WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples, SO THAT they can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GiVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN they load the portfolio
THEN they are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer

WHEN they view the header
THEN they are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio

WHEN they view the navigation titles
THEN they are presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

WHEN they click on a navigation title
THEN they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted

WHEN they load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default

WHEN they are presented with the About Me section
THEN they see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them

WHEN they are presented with the Portfolio section
THEN they see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories

WHEN they are presented with the Contact section
THEN they see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message

WHEN they move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN they receive a notification that this field is required

WHEN they enter text into the email address field
THEN they receive a notification if they have entered an invalid email address

WHEN they are presented with the Resume section
THEN they see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies

WHEN they view the footer
THEN they are presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and Linkedin profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
